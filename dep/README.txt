Using Store-Downloader
store update
store install xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:PORT
(Replace xxx with the server's ip address and PORT by a number)

Adding URL's to Store-Downloader
The Store-Downloader's masterlist is hosted at and URL's can be added through 
https://vc-mp-store-downloader.sourceforge.io/index.html

The URL should be direct and point to a zip file eg. ..../store.zip

Store Files Uploaded on formats other than .zip will not work (.rar, etc )

Files uploaded on Mediafire will not work, because on mediafire there is 'Click to Download' and the program cannot do that.
